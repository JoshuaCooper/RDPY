# RDPY
Basic server for creating .RDP files for sysadmins to provide shortcuts for Remote Desktop Connection. The RDP file type is primarily associated with 'Remote Desktop Connection' by Microsoft Corporation(TM). An .RDP file contains all of the information for a connection to a terminal server.

## Why RDPY
I had some users who weren't familiar with using Remote Desktop Connection when they were traveling. To assist them I would create easy to use shortcuts for them. This tool helps in the generation of these files for a basic connection to their system at head quarers. 

## Limits
This should be run on an internal network only.

It currently doesn't offer support for anything but a basic Domain, Username and Hostname. If someone would like to add features please create an issue or fork it and create a pull request.
